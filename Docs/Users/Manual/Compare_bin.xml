  <para>WinMerge can detect whether files are in text or binary format. When you
  launch a file compare operation on two binary files, WinMerge opens each file
  in the binary file editor.
  For the binary file editor to be operational, WinMerge requires installation
  of <ulink url="http://frhed.sourceforge.net">Frhed 1.6.0</ulink> or later. 
  Be sure to run the Frhed setup to get things registered the proper way.
  Unzipping Frhed binaries doesn't suffice.</para>
