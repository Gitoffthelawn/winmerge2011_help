  <para>WinMerge 2011 binaries are distributed in the form of a 7-Zip archive with a self-extractor stub.
  The archive can be manually extracted using 7-Zip, or it can be turned into an executable setup program
  by changing its filename extension from <filename>.7z</filename> to <filename>.exe</filename>.
  The former option is recommended if you want to run WinMerge from removable media.
  The latter option is recommended if you want to install WinMerge to your machine and have it show up in Windows Explorer shell context menu.</para>
