  <para>WinMerge 2011 binaries are distributed in the form of a 7-Zip archive with a self-extractor stub.
  The archive can be manually extracted using 7-Zip, or it can be turned into an executable setup program
  by changing its filename extension from <filename>.7z</filename> to <filename>.exe</filename>.
  The former option is recommended if you want to run WinMerge from removable media.
  The latter option is recommended if you want to install WinMerge to your machine and have it show up in Windows Explorer shell context menu.</para>
  <para>The latest release can be always downloaded from
    <ulink url="https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011/downloads">here</ulink>.</para>

    <para>WinMerge uses <ulink url="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</ulink> for
    archive support, but the WinMerge installer does not install 7-Zip or
    archive support. Installing the 7-Zip application is recommended but not
    required for archive support. The 7-Zip installer is available for
    downloading from <ulink url="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip.org</ulink>.</para>
    <para>To install archive support, download and install the 7-Zip plugin from
    <ulink url="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge.org</ulink>, as described in the
    <xref linkend="Install_merge7zinstaller"/> section of this topic.</para>
    <para>WinMerge automatically detects an installed 7-zip in the system, so no
    configuration is needed.</para>
    <para>7-zip integration needs a compatible <filename>Merge7z*U.dll</filename>
    file in the WinMerge program directory, where <filename>*</filename> is the
    7-Zip version installed. For example, 7-Zip version 4.42 requires
    <filename>Merge7z442U.dll</filename>. If the required DLL file is missing
    for any reason, you can copy it to the WinMerge directory, for example from
    the <filename>7z-Plugin</filename> archive that is available from the
    WinMerge download page.</para>
    <para>If the <filename>Merge7z*U.dll</filename> file is missing, WinMerge
    displays a message that includes the name of the missing file and the
    recommended version of 7-Zip. You can also display this message by clicking

      <para><filename>Merge7zInstaller</filename> is a stand-alone installer for
      7-Zip integration.</para>
      <para>Installer file names may seem strange at first, but there is reason
      for them: they show the supported versions. The file name is formatted
      as</para>
      <para><synopsis>Merge7zInstaller<replaceable>XXX-YYY-ZZZ</replaceable>.exe</synopsis></para>
      <para>where <replaceable>XXX</replaceable> is the build number,
      <replaceable>YYY</replaceable> is the earliest 7-Zip version supported,
      and <replaceable>ZZZ</replaceable> is the latest 7-Zip version
      supported.</para>
      <para>For example, <filename>Merge7zInstaller0014-311-426.exe</filename>
      means build version 14, support for 7-Zip versions 3.11 to 4.26.</para>
      <para>This separate installer is much more flexible, because we can update
      it whenever 7-Zip is updated, and we don&apos;t add files to the base installer
      that users don&apos;t need.</para>
      <para>The latest version is always available at <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/winmerge/files/7-zip-plugin/" userlevel="">7-Zip plugin</ulink> in our download page at SourceForge.net,
      and of course from our home page at <ulink url="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge.org</ulink>.</para>

        <para>If you want to know immediately when we release new versions, you
        can monitor our releases. You are then notified through e-mail of new
        releases when they happen.</para>

                  can use this option when the 7-Zip application is not wanted
                  or needed.</para>
                  <para>This installation type contains only the files needed

                  It does not install the 7-Zip user interface or other related
                  tools or files. After this installation it is not possible to
                  open or create 7-Zip archive files outside of WinMerge.</para>
