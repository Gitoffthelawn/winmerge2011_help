  <title>Introduction to WinMerge</title>
  <para>WinMerge is an <ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</ulink> differencing and merging tool for Windows. WinMerge can compare
  both folders and files, presenting differences in a visual text format that is
  easy to understand and handle.</para>
  <para>WinMerge is highly useful for determining what has changed between
  project versions, and then merging changes between versions. WinMerge can be
  used as an external differencing/merging tool or as a standalone
  application.</para>
  <para>In addition, WinMerge has many helpful supporting features that make
  comparing, synchronising, and merging as easy and useful as possible. Several
  programming languages and other file formats are syntax-highlighted.</para>
  <para>The goal of WinMerge development is to make comparing, synchronizing,
  and merging folders and files easy and fast, while maintaining maximum
  reliability. Ease of use is of key importance for reducing errors.</para>

        </indexterm>Preview versions</title>
      <para>Preview versions are for people who want to test latest features and
      improvements made after last stable version. Be warned that preview versions are likely to have bugs.
   Preview version numbers comprise four parts, the first of which is always zero. These releases are made
      available to allow users to try out the current code without needing to
      compile, and to participate in development discussions concerning new and
      changing features. We also appreciate any help testing the current code.
      Use preview versions with care and enable backups! And please <ulink url="https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011/issues">report bugs</ulink> that you find while using these builds: it really helps with
      WinMerge development!</para>

    <para>If you find a bug, please submit it to the <ulink url="https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011/issues">issue tracker</ulink>. Please attach as much information as you can: at a minimum,
    the version number of WinMerge that you are using. If you can, also attach a
    configuration log which, you can display by clicking <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Help</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Configuration</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> in the WinMerge window. Good information in a bug report
    makes it more likely that your bug will be fixed quickly.</para>
    <important>
      <para>Include the version number in bug reports. You can check the version
      number by clicking <menuchoice>
